    <p>
    When you're in a non-master branch (remote tracking branch or topic
    branch... I don't know what those mean) don't do plain git push.
    Instead:
    <pre>
    git push origin xyz  # where xyz is the branch you're in/working on
    </pre>
    For reference a "normal" push (when working on master) spelled out
    explicitly is just:
    <pre>
    git push origin master
    </pre>
    (but also see below for a "better" branch workflow.  Hint: you
    rebase before you ever push)

    read and comprehend the NEXT item below -- what Mark Longair says.]

    A git pull trick for checking if you'll run into problems.
    <pre>
    git fetch origin
    git diff paypal origin/paypal  # diffs your local branch against remote-tracking branch
    </pre>

    Mark Longair says that to pull changes from master into your feature
    branch do
    <pre>
    git fetch origin # updates all remote-tracking branches for origin
    git checkout feature
    git merge origin/master
    </pre>
    From a <a
      href="http://longair.net/blog/2009/04/16/git-fetch-and-merge/">great
      article</a> on why you should use fetch + merge instead of pull.
    (This was from the comments.)

      comment</a> he makes on Stack Overflow has good info the git term
    "track" (there are two distinct meanings of the word) and about
    local branches, remote-tracking branches (he uses the hyphen), and
    how it all relates to "the branch in the remote repository".

    when you're done with branch xyz:
    <pre>
      git rebase master  # you're in branch xyz
      git checkout master
      git diff master xyz  # opt.
      git merge xyz
      git branch -d xyz
    </pre>
    </p>
    <hr/>

    <p>
    keeping a branch in sync with master:
    <pre>
    # to be sure
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout xyz
    </pre>
    if you have NOT pushed your branch remotely:
    <pre>
    git rebase master
    </pre>
    if you HAVE pushed your branch remotely:
    <pre>
    git merge master  # this is the most likely scenario for me
    </pre>
    </p>
    <hr/>

    <p>
    dry run for merge (I'm not convinced this is completely "dry"; more
    pointers below for other dry runs):
    </p>
    <pre>
    git merge --no-commit --no-ff &lt;args&gt;
    </pre>
    <hr/>

    <p>
    when git status tells you "your branch is ahead of origin/X by N
    commits but git diff shows no differences, do:
    <pre>
    git diff origin/branchname  # see changes
    git push origin branchname  # square everything away... maybe?
    </pre>
    </p>
    <hr/>

    <p>
    a reasonable seeming branch workflow that I don't happen to follow
    very much.  The idea is you don't push to your remote branch until
    it's been rebased.  I think doing pushes then rebasing sets up the
    "your branch is ahead..." message and possibly creates what look
    like duplicate commits on github which just seems wrong/weird.  So
    the workflow is like:
    </p>
    <pre>
    code...code...
    commit
    switch to master (git co master)
    git pull
    switch back to branch (git co branchname)
    git rebase master
    git push origin branchname
    </pre>
    This keeps you always up-to-date with any changes in master.
