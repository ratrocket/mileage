DONE:
- convert to postgres (done?)
- authentication (means users too...) (using nifty stuff)
- ssl required on everything -- use Rack middleware:
  http://goo.gl/0U5mz (stackoverflow; not quite rails 3 I don't think...)
  http://goo.gl/C4YjM (rails guide to Rack)
  (using Rack::SSL)
- turn off signup before it goes to heroku (login_required for ALL
  actions in all controllers, including  users#new!)
- get it going on heroku:
- use thin (working locally, need Procfile for heroku?)

TODO:

- TESTS
- feature: saved ride profiles/templates (for common rides: commutes,
  etc.)
- get laptop setup to deploy to heroku:
