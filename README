== Track mileage simply.

DONE:
- convert to postgres (done?)
- authentication (means users too...) (using nifty stuff)
- ssl required on everything -- use Rack middleware:
  http://goo.gl/0U5mz (stackoverflow; not quite rails 3 I don't think...)
  http://goo.gl/C4YjM (rails guide to Rack)
  (using Rack::SSL)
- turn off signup before it goes to heroku (login_required for ALL
  actions in all controllers, including  users#new!)

TODO:

- get it going on heroku:
  - use thin (working locally, need Procfile for heroku?)
- TESTS
